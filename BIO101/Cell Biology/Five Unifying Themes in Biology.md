## Evolution is the Core Theme of Biology

### Darwins Theory of Evolution:

Darwin published *On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selction.* in November 1859

He collected documented plants animnals and fossil data from the isolated GalÃ¡pagos Islands to the heights of the Anded Mountains to the Rain Forest in Brazel

The species living today arose from a succession of ancestors that were
different from them.
Which he called **Descent with Modification** (modification that evoled as species diverged from their ancestors)
Which also includes **Descent from a common ancestors**

He also proposed a Mechanism for evolution which he called ***Natural Selection***	   

##### Darwins Two Observations

1. ***Individual Variation***: Individuals in a population vary in their traits, many of which seem to be heritable
	   **Inference:** 
	   ***Unequal Reproductive Success:*** Indivuduals with inherited traits best suited to the local environment are more likely to survive and reproduce than are less well-suited individuals
 
 2. ***Overproduction of offspring:*** All species can produce far more offspring than the environment can support. Competition for resources is thus inevitable, and many of these offspring fail to survive and reproduce
	   **Inference:**
	   ***Accumulation of favourable traits over time:*** As a result of this unequal reproductive success over many generations, a higher and higher proportion of individuals in the population will have the advantageous traits.

>He proposed that new species could evolve as a result of the gradual accumlation of changes ove rlong periods of time.

### The Tree of Life:

---Not Important?---

$Q.$ Explain the cause and effect of unequal repoductive success.
> Those individuals with heritable traits best suited to the local environment produce the greatest number of offspring. Over many generations, the proportion of these adaptive traits increase in the population

-------------------------------------

## Evolution is connected to our everday lives:

But humans also affect evolution **unintentionally**. The impact of habitat loss and climate change can be seen in the loss of species.
It is estimated that the current rate of extinction is 100-1000 times the rate seen in fossil record

For Example,
Our widespread use of anti-biotics and pesticides has led to the evolution of antibiotics resistance in bacteria and pesticide restistance in insects.

$Q.$ Explain how humans are agents of both artificial selection and natural selection
> We use artificial selection when choosing species traits or genes in organisms that we breed. Our **intentional** and **unintentional**manipulations change the environment and thus affect natural selection.

## Theme: Life depends on the flow of information

### Genetic Information

DNA provides all the instructions for the cell function and it also carries the heritable information that is to be passed from one generation to the other.

#### The Struction of DNA
- Double Helix
- The Strands are made up of Four kinds of Nucleotide Bonds (A,T,C,G)
- The Nucleotides have fixed pairing 
   A $\rightarrow$ T   &   C $\rightarrow$ G

Specific sequences of these four chemical letters encode precise information in units of inheritance called ***Genes***
Genes provide the blueprint for making ***Protiens***
