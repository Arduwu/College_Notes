## Evolution is the Core Theme of Biology

### Darwins Theory of Evolution:

Darwin published *On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selction.* in November 1859

He collected documented plants animnals and fossil data from the isolated GalÃ¡pagos Islands to the heights of the Anded Mountains to the Rain Forest in Brazel

The species living today arose from a succession of ancestors that were
different from them.
Which he called **Descent with Modification** (modification that evoled as species diverged from their ancestors)
Which also includes **Descent from a common ancestors**

He also proposed a Mechanism for evolution which he called ***Natural Selection***	   

##### Darwins Two Observations

1. ***Individual Variation***: Individuals in a population vary in their traits, many of which seem to be heritable
	   **Inference:** 
	   ***Unequal Reproductive Success:*** Indivuduals with inherited traits best suited to the local environment are more likely to survive and reproduce than are less well-suited individuals
 
 2. ***Overproduction of offspring:*** All species can produce far more offspring than the environment can support. Competition for resources is thus inevitable, and many of these offspring fail to survive and reproduce
	   **Inference:**
	   ***Accumulation of favourable traits over time:*** As a result of this unequal reproductive success over many generations, a higher and higher proportion of individuals in the population will have the advantageous traits.

>He proposed that new species could evolve as a result of the gradual accumlation of changes ove rlong periods of time.
