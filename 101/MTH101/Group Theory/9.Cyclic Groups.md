A group $G$ is said to be cyclic if there exists an element $a \in G$ such that $G=\:<a>$


## Structure of Cyclic Groups

We have two possibilities here
- $ord(a)$ is not finite
- $ord(a)$ is finite

#### Case 1: $ord(a)$ is not finite
This means there does not exists a positive integer $m$ such that $a^{m}=1$
Consider
	$\dots,a^{-2},a^{-1},1,a,a^{2}\dots$
We claim all these elements are distinct.  i.e, $a^{i} \neq a^{j}$
Suppose this is not true.
	Then $a^{i}=a^{j} \implies a^{j-1}=1$
	As $j-i>0$ , this contradicts our assumption that $ord(a)$ is not finite
Anyways,
Let $\phi : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow G$ be the function defined by $\phi(n) = a^{n}$
We can say that $\phi$ is a bijection
And,
$$
\begin{align}
\phi(m+n) &= a^{m+n} \\
&= a^{m} \cdot a^{n} \\
&= \phi(m) \cdot \phi(n)
\end{align}
$$
Thus $\phi$ is a group isomorphism

#### Case 2: $ord(a)$ is finite

##### Theorem:
Suppose $a^{n}=1$ for some integer $n$. Then, $m \: | \: n$

***Proof:***
> Using the division algorithm we write $n=mq+r$ 
> Then,
$$
\begin{align}
1 = a^{n} &= a^{mq+r} \\
&=(a^{m})^{q} \:\cdot \: a^{r} \\
&=1 \: \cdot \: a^{r} \\
&=a^{r}
\end{align}
$$
