A group $G$ is said to be cyclic if there exists an element $a \in G$ such that $G=\:<a>$


## Structure of Cyclic Groups

We have two possibilities here
- $ord(a)$ is not finite
- $ord(a)$ is finite

#### Case 1: $ord(a)$ is not finite
This means there does not exists a positive integer $m$ such that $a^{m}=1$
Consider
	$\dots,a^{-2},a^{-1},1,a,a^{2}\dots$
We claim all these elements are distinct.  i.e, $a^{i} \neq a^{j}$
Suppose this is not true.
