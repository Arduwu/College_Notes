Let $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ be two groups 
We define "a" binary operation on $G_{1}$x$G_{2}$ by setting
$$(a_{1},a_{2})\cdot(b_{1},b_{2})=(a_{1}b_{1},a_{2}b_{2})$$
where,   $a_{1},b_{1} \in G_{1}$  and $a_{2} , b_{2} \in G_{2}$
Thus,
$G_{1}$x$G_{2}$  is a group under this binary operation
- The identity element is $(1_{G_{1}},1_{G_{2}})$
- The inverse of $(x,y)$ is $(x^{-1}, y^{-1})$
- It is denoted by $G_{1}$x$G_{2}$  or
