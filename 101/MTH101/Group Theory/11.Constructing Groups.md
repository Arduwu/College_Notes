Let $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ be two groups 
We define "a" binary operation on $G_{1}$x$G_{2}$ by setting
$$(a_{1},a_{2})\cdot(b_{1},b_{2})=(a_{1}b_{1},a_{2}b_{2})$$
where,   $a_{1},b_{1} \in G_{1}$  and $a_{2} , b_{2} \in G_{2}$
Thus,
$G_{1}$x$G_{2}$  is a group under this binary operation
- The identity element is $(1_{G_{1}},1_{G_{2}})$
- The inverse of $(x,y)$ is $(x^{-1}, y^{-1})$
- It is denoted by $G_{1}$x$G_{2}$  or  $G_{1} \oplus G_{2}$

***Example:***
$\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} = \{ \:(\bar{0},\bar{0}) , (\bar{1},\bar{0}), (\bar{0},\bar{1}),(\bar{1},\bar{1}),(\bar{0},\bar{2}),(\bar{1},\bar{2})\:\}$
and
$ord(\bar{1},\bar{1})=6$
Thus,
$\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}$

## Group Homomorphisms

Let $G$ and $H$ be groups.
A group homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ is a function $\phi: G \rightarrow H$  such that
$$
\phi(g_{1}g_{2}) = \phi(g_{1}) \cdot \phi(g_{2})
$$
for $g_{1},g_{2} \in G$

- Any group isomorphism is a group homomorphism
- Let $m$ be a positive integer. The function $f: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$    defined by $f(n) = n + m$
