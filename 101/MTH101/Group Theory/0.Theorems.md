[Theorem 1.1 - Definition of Identity](<1.Groups#More on Identity Element:#Uniqueness of Identity>)
Let $G$ be a group and let $f$ be an element of $G$ such that $f x = x$ for some $x$ in $G$.
Then, $f = 1_{G}$

[Theorem 1.2](<1.Groups#Inverses:#Uniqueness of Inverses:>)
Let $G$ be a group and let $f$ be an element of $G$.
If $h$ is an element such that $fh = 1_{G}$, then $h = f^{-1}$.
Similarly,
	if $h$ satisfies $hf = 1_{G}$, then
	$h = f^{-1}$.


[Theorem 3.1](3.Isomorphism.md#Theorem-1)
	If $\phi: G \rightarrow H$ be an isomorphism. Then,
		1. $\phi(1_{G}) = 1_{H}$	
		2. For any $x \in G$ , $\phi(x^{-1}) = \phi(x)^{-1}$

[Theorem 3.2](<3.Isomorphism.md#Theorem-2>)
	Let $G$ and $H$ be groups. Let $\phi:G \rightarrow H$ be a group isomorphism.
	Then, the function $\phi ^{-1}: H \rightarrow G$ is also a group isomorphism

[Theorem 4.1](<4.Sub-Groups.md#A Test for Subgroups#Theorem>)
	Let $G$ be a group. Let $H$ be a non-empty subset of $G$.
	Then $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ $\iff$ for any $x,y$ in $H$

[Theorem 4.2](<4.Sub-Groups#Order of a Group:#Finite Groups:#Theorem>)
	Let $G$ be a finite group. Then, for any element $x$ of $G$, there exists a positive integer $d \leq |G|$ such that $x^{d} = 1$

[Theorem 5.1](<5.Lagrange's Theorem.md#Theorem>)
	Let $G$ be a [finite group.](Sub-Groups.md#Order%20of%20a%20Group#Finite%20Groups of a Group#Finite Groups>) Then , for any $x \in G$, 
	$ord(x) \leq |G|$
