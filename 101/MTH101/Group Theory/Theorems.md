	If $\phi: G \rightarrow H$ be an isomorphism. Then,
		1. $\phi(1_{G}) = 1_{H}$	
		2. For any $x \in G$ , $\phi(x^{-1}) = \phi(x)^{-1}$

[Theorem 2.2](<Isomorphism#Theorem-2)
	Let $G$ and $H$ be groups. Let $\phi:G \rightarrow H$ be a group isomorphism.
	Then, the function $\phi ^{-1}: H \rightarrow G$ is also a group isomorphism

[Theorem 3.1](4.Sub-Groups.md#A%20Test%20for%20Subgroups#Theorem Test for Subgroups#Theorem>)
	Let $G$ be a group. Let $H$ be a non-empty subset of $G$.
	Then $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ $\iff$ for any $x,y$ in $H$

[Theorem 3.2](<Sub-Groups#Order of a Group:#Finite Groups:#Theorem>)
	Let $G$ be a finite group. Then, for any element $x$ of $G$, there exists a positive integer $d \leq |G|$ such that $x^{d} = 1$

	Let $G$ be a [finite group.](Sub-Groups.md#Order%20of%20a%20Group#Finite%20Groups of a Group#Finite Groups>) Then , for any $x \in G$, 
	$ord(x) \leq |G|$
