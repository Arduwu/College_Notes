[Theorem 2.1](<Sub-Groups#A Test for Subgroups#Theorem>)
Let $G$ be a group. Let $H$ be a non-empty subseet of $G$.
Then $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ $\iff$ for any $x,y$ in $H$


[Theorem 2.2](<Sub-Groups#Order of a Group:#Finite Groups:#Theorem>)
Let $G$ be a finite group. Then, for any element $x$ of $G$, there exists a positive integer $d \leq |G|$ such that $x^{d} = 1$
