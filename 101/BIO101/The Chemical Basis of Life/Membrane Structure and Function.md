## Membranes are fluid mosaics of lipids and proteins with many functions

Biologists use the fluid mosaic model to describe a membrane's structure 
i.e, a diverse protein molecules suspended ina fluid phsopholipid bilayer.
This model illustrates the structure and function of a plasma membrane.

## The spontaneous formation of membranes was a critical step in the origin of life

#### Phospholipids
Probably among the first organic molecules that formed from chemical reactions on early Earth
