## Membranes are fluid mosaics of lipids and proteins with many functions

Biologists use the fluid mosaic model to describe a membrane's structure 
i.e, a diverse protein molecules suspended ina fluid phsopholipid bilayer.
This model illustrates the structure and function of a plasma membrane.

------------------

## The spontaneous formation of membranes was a critical step in the origin of life

#### Phospholipids
- Among the first organic molecules that formed from chemical reactions on early Earth
- These lipids could spontaneously self-assemble into simple membranes.
	  We can demonstrate this by shaking phospholipids and water. The lipids will form a bilayer surrounding around water-filled bubbles

$Q.$ *What is the basic requirement for life to form?*
> A membrane that not only encolses a successful assembly of molecules but also regulates chemical exchanges with the environment.
> For regulation the membrane should contain proteins embedded into it, cause only simple lipid bilayers are not sufficient


---------------------
## Passive Transport is diffusion across a membrane with no energy investment

***Diffusion:*** 
- The tendency for particles of any substance to spread out into the available space
- Two or more subtances diffuse independenty of each other, i.e, each diffuses down its own concentration gradient
- Because cell does not have to do work when molecules diffuse across its membrane, such movement is caled ***PASSIVE TRANSPORT***
