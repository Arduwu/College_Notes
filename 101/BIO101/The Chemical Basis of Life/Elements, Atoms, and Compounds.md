## Organisms are composed of elements, usually combined into compounds

How many elements are essential for life? For example, Humans need 25 elements, but plants require only 17


#### What Elements do in our body

 - Calcium (Ca) and Phosphorus (P) are the major components of your ***bones and teeth.***
 - Accounting for the remaining 1% of your body, Potassium (K), Sulfur, Sodium, Chlorine, and Magnesium are involved in functions such as nerve signaling and chemical reactions.
 - The ***TRACE ELEMENTS*** are present in minute quantities, making up less than $0.01$% of human weight. They include Boron, Chorium, Cobalt, Copper, Fluorine, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Selenium, Silicon, Tin, Vanadium, and Zinc
 - ***Iron*** Makes up only $0.004$% of your body weight but is vital for energy proccessing and for transporting oxygen in your blood. It is a Trace element needed by every organisms or forms of life.
 - ***Iodine*** is essential only for vertebrates (Animal with Backbones).
   Some effects of iodine deficiency leads to miscarriages, poor growth, and mental impairment. Deficiencies are usually found in inland regions
   as Seafood, kelp, dairy products and dark leafy greens are good natural sources.
   A Global stratergy to eleminate iodine deficiency involves unviersal iodization of all salts.
   
   

$Q.$ Explain how table salt illustrates the concept of emergent properties
>The elements that make up the edible crystals of table salt, sodium and chlorine are in pure form a metal and a poisonous gas.

## Trace Elements are common additives to food and water

Relating to our previous discusion about Iodine, we saw that its a common additive in salts, other such exmaple includes **Iron**

##### Iron Deficiency
 - **Iron** deficiency is the world's most common nutritional disorder.
- Stratergies for addressing the challenge of iron deficiency include food foritfication, iron supplements and diet diversification and improvement.
- In US, wheat flour has been fortified with iron since the 1940s, and iron is commonly added to processed foods such as cereal.
