## Hydrogen bonds make liquid water cohesive

#### Cohesion
Tendency of molecules of the same kind to stick together.

Trees depend on cohesion to help transport water and nutrients from their roots to their leaves. The evaporation of water from a leaf exerts a pulling force on water within the veins of the leaf. Because of Cohesion, the force is relayed all the way down to the roots.

#### Adhesion
The tendency of dissimilar particles or surfaces to cling to one another.

The thinness of a plant's veins enchances the adhesion of water to its cell walls, helping to counter the downward pull of gravity.

#### Surface Tension
A measure of how Difficult it is to stretch or break the surface of a liquid.
Hydrogen-Bonds give water unusually high surface tension


$Q.$ After a hard workout, you may notice “beads” of sweat on your face. Can you explain what holds the sweat in droplet form on your face?
>The Cohesion of water molecules and its high surface tension hold water in droplets. The Adhesion of water to your skin helps hold the beads in place


## Water's Hydrogen bonds moderate Temperature

***Thermal Energy:*** Energy associated with the random movement of atoms and molecules
***Head:*** Transfer of thermal energy from warmer to a cooler body of matter
***Temperature:*** The Intensity of heat
