Newtonian mechanics breaks down for systems moving with a speed comparable to the speed of light, $3 × 108 m/s$, and also for systems of atomic dimensions or smaller where quantum effects are significant. 
The failure arises because of limitations to the classical concepts of space, time, and the nature of measurement.

## First Law

Motion has meaning only when measures w.r.t a particular coordinate system.

***"Newton’s first law of motion is the assertion that inertial systems exist."***

Isolated bodies move uniformly in intertial systems by virtue of the definition of an intertial system.


## Second Law

When applied a Force to a body, the accelaration not only depends on what we do to the object, But also on some property of the object (called **mass**)

**Second Law holds true only in intertial systems**

#### Defining Mass

we take first body of masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ and define them as
$$
m_{2} \equiv m_{1} \frac{a_{1}}{a_{2}}
$$
continuing the same procedure for different mass $m_{3}$ and $m_{4}$
Even with perfoming different types of motion (say with a spring or a string), We get the same relation
Thus mass turns out to be independent of the source of acceleration but appears to be an inherent property of the body.

***Operational Concepts:***
	Out Definition of mass is operational definition, meaning it is dominantly in temr sof experiments we perform and not in terms of abstract concepets, such as "“mass is a measure of the resistance of bodies to a change in motion".
	Operational definitions may be satisfying theoretically, but they can be useless in practice because in principle they are limited to situations in which the operations can be carried out. However, this is not usually a problem; physics proceeds by constructing a chain of theory and experiment that allows us to employ convenient methods of measurement but that are ultimately based on the operational definitions

#### Defining Force

Unit Force is something that produces unit accelaration when applied to the unit mass
Thus the force will produce $F × (1/m)$ of acceleration when acting on mass $m$.

**TtNWA:** mass varying in different directions

Thus we get $$
F = ma
$$
## Third Law

The third law states that forces always appear in pairs that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
**There is never a lone force without a partner.**

>Third law is essential if the second law is to be meaningful,
   without it, there would be no way to knnow whether an acceleration results from a real force, or is merely an artifact of being in an non-inertial system.
