Let $(G, \ast)$ and $(H,\odot)$ be two groups
A group **Isomorphism** from $(G, \ast)$ to $(H, \odot)$ is a $1-1$ correspondence 
$$
\begin{align} \\
\phi: G \rightarrow H
\end{align}
$$
such that 
$$
\begin{align}
\phi(x \ast y) =   \phi(x) \odot \phi(y)
\end{align}
$$
for all $x,y$ in $G$

We say that two groups are isomorphic if there exists a group isomorpism from one to the other

> In simple words, when two multiplication table of two function are similar or in some sense the same

***For Ex.***
>Let $\mathbb{R}_{+}$ be the set of positive real numbers.
>where it is a group under binary operation of multiplication.
>We denote this group by $(\mathbb{R}_{+}, \cdot)$
>
>Let $\phi(x)=a^{x}$.
> $$
\begin{align}
\phi(x+y)  & = a^{x+y} \\
&=a^{ }
\end{align}
