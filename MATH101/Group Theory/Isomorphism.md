Let $(G, \ast)$ and $(H,\odot)$ be two groups
A group **Isomorphism** from $(G, \ast)$ to $(H, \odot)$ is a $1-1$ correspondence 
$$
\begin{align} \\
\phi: G \rightarrow H
\end{align}
$$
such that 
$$
\begin{align}
\phi(x \ast y) =   \phi(x) \odot \phi(y)
\end{align}
$$
for all $x,y$ in $G$

We say that two groups are isomorphic if there exists a group isomorpism from one to the other
