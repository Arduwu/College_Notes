#### List all groups of order 6 and 7

We know that a group of order 6 would contain one set as
$$
({id, x, x^2, x^{3},x^{4}, x^{5}})
$$
Now, we need to find other sets of order 6

To do this, we need to find what can be the order of elements of the set

**Order of Element**
> power of an element which takes it to $id$

Lets take an element $y$ in the set
$$
(id, x, x^2, x^{3},x^{4}, y)
$$
Where,
-  $y^{2} = 1$
