Let $(G, \ast)$ be a group. A subgroup of $G$ is a subset $H  \subseteq  G$ such that $\ast$  gives a binary operation on $H$ , which gives $H$ the structure of a group.

#### Properties of a Subgroup

- $1_{G}$ is in $H$
- $x, y$ in $H$  $\implies$ $x \ast y$ in $H$
- $x$ in $H$ $\implies$ $x^{-1}$ in $H$
