Let $(G, \ast)$ be a group. A subgroup of $G$ is a subset $H  \subseteq  G$ such that $\ast$  gives a binary operation on $H$ , which gives $H$ the structure of a group.

#### Properties of a Subgroup

- $1_{G}$ is in $H$
- $x, y$ in $H$  $\implies$ $x \ast y$ in $H$
- $x$ in $H$ $\implies$ $x^{-1}$ in $H$

**Note**
> Any subgroup of $G$ that is not equal to the whole of $G$ is called a ***proper*** subgroup of $G$

***Example***
	Let $G$ be a group and let $x$ be any elemebnt of $G$.
	Then, the set
$$
\begin{align}
<x> &= \{x^{n} | \text\mathrm{n is an integer} \\
&=\{ 1_{G}, x, x^{-1}, x^{2}, x^{-2} \dots \}
\end{align}
$$
